1928 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 251

I haven't any plan for any particular activity during the campaign. I have been active during the interval that has accrued between the 2nd day of August, 1923, to the present time undertaking to so conduct the affairs of the Government that the record made by my party might commend itself to the voters of the nation. I am continuing in that hope and the conduct of the office at the present time.
