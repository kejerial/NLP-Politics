1929 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 273

... it is never possible to make much of a determination in advance of what the action of the Senate will be relative to the time of securing a vote on any question that is pending there. Oftentimes it looks as though there would be a long debate and it is determined within an hour. Sometimes it is apparent that a vote will be reached very soon and something comes up that makes the question drag along for weeks. But the Senate has a way of reaching a vote when it wants to and I have no doubt that that will be the result on the cruiser bill. It looked at one time, you will recall, as though there might be a very extended debate on the peace treaty, but all at once the Senate agreed and were able to take a vote on it. Very likely, the same result will occur in relation to the cruiser bill.
