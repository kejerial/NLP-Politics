1946 Remarks Members The Conference Called Develop Food Conservation Program

I APPRECIATE very much your being here today. We are in a very serious condition, so far as world food consumption is concerned. I sincerely believe that with your advice and your help we will be able to work this program out, so that the people who are now on the verge of starvation may live through the next year.
It is the most important meeting I think we have held in the White House since I have been the President.
I particularly want to thank Mr. Hoover, and the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Commerce, and each one of you individually, for coming here today to help on this program.
Thank you very much.
