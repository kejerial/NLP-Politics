1905 Remarks Colorado Springs Colorado 0

Let me say one word of special greeting to the veterans of the Grand Army. To you, my comrades, I wish to say that I have just come up from Texas, and it would have done your hearts good, you men who wore the blue in the great war, to see how, side by side with your comrades who wore the blue, stood the men who wore the gray, united with them now for ever and ever with one flag and one country. De lighted though I was with every feature of my reception in Texas, I think that the feature that pleased me most was that of which I have just spoken, to see the old Union and Confederate veterans stand together under the old flag.
Now, I am going to make a request of the people of Colorado. I am off on a hunt. One thing you cannot do on a hunt, and that is to carry a brass band. You cannot combine hunting bears with your Fourth of July celebrations, so I am going to beg the people of Colorado to treat me on this hunt just as well as the people of Oklahoma treated me on the wolf hunt. If a lot of newspaper men start to come in after me, I will have to come home; that's all there is to it. The thing they can do that will please me best is to let me be on that hunt alone, and pay no earthly attention to me, or to any of my party, while I am off in the mountains.
