1930 The Presidents News Conference 783

SPANISH WAR VETERANS' PENSIONS
THE PRESIDENT. I have had a number of questions about the veto yesterday--or overriding the veto.
I favored a liberalizing of the Spanish War veterans' pensions, because they have not been on a parity with the other services. But even yet I have not changed my opinion that it should have been worked out in a way that rich and well-to-do people with substantial incomes should not draw pensions from this Government. I made no suggestion at any time of a pauper provision against veterans, or anything akin to it.
I do not believe yet that we should alter the principles which have been held for Civil War veterans all of these 70 years, providing for the 90-day requirement of service.
And further than that, I do not believe yet that it is right to change our national policy and to call on the Nation to pay disability allowances to men who have or who may tomorrow destroy their health through vicious habits. And I have received a very large number of communications from veterans throughout the country supporting those views.
That is the only subject on which I have any questions.
