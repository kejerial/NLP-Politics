1930 The Presidents News Conference 718

THE PRESIDENT. I am sorry I haven't anything that I can tell you about without making trouble for somebody else, and on this occasion I will keep still.
I haven't had any very great crop of questions of late, so I assume that you are able to get most of the news needed from some other quarter.
LONDON NAVAL CONFERENCE
Q. Not from London, Mr. President ?
THE PRESIDENT. I think they are getting ahead in London--making progress.
THE HAITIAN COMMISSION
Q. Is there any new development from Haiti that you can speak about, Mr. President ?
THE PRESIDENT. We have had a telegram from the Commission stating that they think they have reached a settlement of a program.
Q. With Borno?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, with all sides. I assumed that was in the press from down there.
Q. Yes, it was, this morning.
THE PRESIDENT. So I am afraid I can't add anything to the current supply.
