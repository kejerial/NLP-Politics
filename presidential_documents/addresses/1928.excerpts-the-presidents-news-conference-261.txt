1928 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 261

As has already been announced from Palo Alto, Mr. Hoover is thinking of making a trip to South America. I have wired him to advise me what he would like to have the Government do to assist him. He says he would like to have the warship Maryland assigned for the journey and that his purpose in making the journey is to evidence the good will and desire for mutual cooperation between the United States and South America and to familiarize himself with the common problems. He says also that the matter hasn't been finally determined. I am having the State Department make the usual inquiries as to whether the places he is expecting to visit would be agreeable to receive him. He spoke to me about this the last time I saw him as a matter that he would like to do after election. I told him I would be very glad to afford any cooperation he might require.
