1930 The Presidents News Conference 785

LONDON NAVAL TREATY
THE PRESIDENT. It is my understanding that the advocates of the naval treaty in the Senate are earnestly striving to secure action in the present session. If it should prove impossible to complete it at the regular session, I shall call a special session immediately following the regular session for the sole purpose of dealing with the treaty. The leaders of the Senate have been consulted, and they are in agreement with this program.
Other than that I have nothing today.
