WAR DEPARTMENT ECONOMY CONFERENCE
I have a question on whether we are going to the Rapidan Camp this week. I am calling a meeting of the Secretary of War and the Chief of Staff, the Quartermaster General, the Chief of Engineers, and the two Assistant Secretaries of War at the Rapidan on next Saturday. We shall leave here sometime during the day Saturday and return in time for dinner Sunday night. We are taking advantage of that occasion and the opportunity to discuss various matters in connection with the War Department over the weekend.
Otherwise I have nothing this morning.
Q. Mr. President, can you give us anything more specific as to what you will discuss ?
THE PRESIDENT. No. We will discuss the whole of the work of the Department--to a large extent public works.
