1949 Remarks Upon Receiving The Robert S Abbott Memorial Award

Thank you very much. I appreciate it, and hope very much that I will continue to deserve it.
The statement was made, I think before the election last fall, that the principles for which we are fighting are just as old as the Constitution of the United States, and just as new as the Democratic Platform of 1948.
We are pressing for the implementation of that platform, and shall continue to press for it until we accomplish the purpose which was set out. That's about all I can say.
