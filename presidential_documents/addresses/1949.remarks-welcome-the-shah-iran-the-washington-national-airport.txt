1949 Remarks Welcome The Shah Iran The Washington National Airport

Your Majesty:
I am happy to welcome you to the United States on this, your first visit here. I have looked forward to Your Majesty's visit with great pleasure, and I trust that during its course you may have the opportunity of becoming well acquainted with our country. I trust, too, that we may have the opportunity of acquiring through Your Majesty a better knowledge of Iran, its heritage of greatness and culture, and the courage and farsightedness with which present-day Iran, led by Your Majesty, is facing the problems of the modern world.
Our two countries were partners in the struggle against fascism. The traditional friendship which bound us together during those troubled times has grown even stronger in the years since the war. Your Majesty's visit represents the high point of this relationship, which will, I am sure, become still closer in the years ahead.
You have come a long way to be with us, and we are very grateful.
On behalf of the people of the United States, I bid you a most hearty welcome.
