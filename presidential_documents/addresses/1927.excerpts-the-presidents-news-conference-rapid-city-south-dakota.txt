1927 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference Rapid City South Dakota

I have a very fine location out at the State Game Lodge. I think most of you have been out there. It is just exactly what I like. I had a fine and pleasant trip across the country. I was very much interested in seeing the country that I was able to see on my trip out. Some of the people that came down to the station I wasn't able to see very well because about the station there is a great cloud of dust that comes up. That is because the ground around there is used to bring freight in for shipment and take freight out, and the soil is pulverized and soft and oftentimes I would go out on the back platform to see the people that were standing at the station and all I would be able to see when I got out there was a cloud of dust. I couldn't see them and I suppose they couldn't see me.
I was also sorry I didn't know when we went through Madison, Wisconsin. I understand there was quite a crowd down there to pay their respects to our party. They were only able to see the train go through. I didn't know when we were going through there, otherwise I should have been most anxious to get out on the back platform.
The trout that I caught yesterday were rainbow trout. I never happened to catch any of those before. They are a very good game fish to catch and very good fish for the table. I thought my first fishing trip in the hills was attended with very excellent luck.

There are no developments, so far as I am aware, in the French proposal relative to outlawing war. I think the Secretary of State has already announced that he has sent some message or a note to France relative to it. Has he not made an announcement of that kind?
PRESS: Yes, sir.
