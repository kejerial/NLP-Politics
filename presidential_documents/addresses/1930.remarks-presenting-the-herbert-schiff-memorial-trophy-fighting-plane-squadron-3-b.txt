1930 Remarks Presenting The Herbert Schiff Memorial Trophy Fighting Plane Squadron 3 B

Lieutenant Commander Ginder:
You, as Commanding Officer of Fighting Plane Squadron 3-B, attached to the Carrier Lexington, have been designated by the Navy Department to receive, for your squadron, the Herbert Schiff Memorial Trophy. During approximately 5,000 hours of flying, covering about 600,000 miles, your squadron has displayed for the fiscal year 1930 the greatest vigilance, safety, and reliability in flight operations among the Navy's fighting squadrons. This truly is a very remarkable performance, which could not be obtained without splendid leadership on your part and most efficient and expert flying on the part of each member of your squadron. Please accept my congratulations which I extend through you to all members of Fighting Plane Squadron 3-B.
