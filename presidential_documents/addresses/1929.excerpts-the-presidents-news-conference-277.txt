1929 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 277

I do not contemplate any trips to foreign countries after the 4th of March. I think I have been invited to go to different foreign countries. I don't know just which ones. I think several South American countries with whose representatives and citizens I have happened to come in contact have expressed to me a desire to have me visit their countries.
Now that I am thinking of that, I recall especially the delegation that was in the other day from the Argentine, a delegation of 15 or 20 people, and the man who had charge of presenting them to me expressed a very ardent desire that I should visit that country, and hoped I might come in the immediate future. But I have no plans for anything of that kind. I always tell people that I have so many places still to go to in the United States that I don't know when those will be so much exhausted that I will arrive at a time when I can visit other countries.
