1927 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 187

I haven't any report today from Nicaragua. The only thing that I am certain about down there from reports that I have received is that Mr. Stimson is doing his best to compose the differences and find some method by which peace can be restored. Perhaps the method that he may employ is not so very important, if it results in bringing about an amicable condition. I think perhaps it would be well not to take too literally what the contending sides may think it is necessary to give out as publicity, but keep in mind that the main effort of this country is to restore peace and prevent further bloodshed. I have great hopes that Mr. Stimson is going to be able to bring that about.
