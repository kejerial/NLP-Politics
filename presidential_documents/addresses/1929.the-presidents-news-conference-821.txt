1929 The Presidents News Conference 821

THE PRESIDENT. Well, I have a complete blank on this occasion, and I don't think that we will bother to have a conference on Tuesday. You will want to go away for Christmas, and I will be too lazy, so I wish to take this occasion to wish you a merry Christmas, and will have a chance to wish you a happy new year later on.
Q. Will there be a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Mr. President ?
THE PRESIDENT. I hadn't thought about it, but now that you mention it I will take your advice.
Q. Do you want to tell us about your Christmas plans ?
THE PRESIDENT. I have none. The house is making the usual preparation of green and things that belong to the season. I don't expect to go away and there is nothing special happening.
Q. Are Christmas presents arriving at the White House ?
THE PRESIDENT. One or two turkeys already in.
