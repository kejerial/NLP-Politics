1928 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 242

It was brought to my attention today that the
National Zeitung
of Berlin on the 21st of April printed what they said was an article by me. I never wrote any such article and never authorized it. It was an entire fake. Yet it had a heading on it which was signed "The Editor, " saying that it was my article. I tell you that so if you see it none of you may feel slighted because you didn't get the fake.
PRESS: Could you tell us what the story was?
PRESIDENT: It purported to be some statement by me about American conditions, international relations, and so on. I didn't read it.
