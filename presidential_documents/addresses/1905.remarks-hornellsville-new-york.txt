1905 Remarks Hornellsville New York

My friends:
It is a great pleasure to me to be back here again. I have been more than once to your city and I know this region of the country well. I always am glad to be traveling through it and now to have the chance of greeting you while I am President. In passing through Pennsylvania and New York to-day and realizing the happiness and prosperity of our people, I have felt so much that we ought all of us to realize that there is one portion of our country now which has been overtaken by a great disaster.
The city of New Orleans is suffering in its contest with yellow fever and no one who has not been through an epidemic of that kind can appreciate the fall horror that it brings. The national government is now doing whatever it can do to help New Orleans. As yet that sympathy is limited simply to the action of the medical branch. We stand ready to help that great city at any time and I know that the sympathy of every other part of the country goes out to the people of New Orleans, and all Louisiana as they battle valiantly against the foe that has come upon them.
