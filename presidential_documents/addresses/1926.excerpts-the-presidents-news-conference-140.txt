1926 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 140

I haven't any expectation of making a visit to Plymouth in the near future.
PRESS: May I ask how your father is getting along?
PRESIDENT: My father is not suffering any pain. Mr. Stearns went up to see him at my request. He was up there Wednesday and again Thursday. He said father was cheerful and contented and not suffering any pain, but of course is confined to his bed. I speak to him over the telephone nearly every day.
