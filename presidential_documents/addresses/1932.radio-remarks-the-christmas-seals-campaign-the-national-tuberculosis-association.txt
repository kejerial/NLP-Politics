1932 Radio Remarks The Christmas Seals Campaign The National Tuberculosis Association

For 25 years the National Tuberculosis Association and its affiliated units have been fighting tuberculosis. Today they begin their annual appeal for support through the medium of the Christmas Seal sale. The funds obtained finance a program of clinics, nursing service, preventoria, research, and education.
I commend this work to the American public as worthy of generous support. Tuberculosis, despite the steady gains that have been made against it, is still one, if not indeed the first, of our major public health problems.
It is my sincere wish that the Christmas Seal campaign will be successful so that the work of the 2,084 tuberculosis associations may continue unchecked and a still further reduction in the death rate may be achieved during the coming year.
