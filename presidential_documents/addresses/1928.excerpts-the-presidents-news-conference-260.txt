1928 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 260

I haven't seen any reference to any address made by Wickham Steed, an Englishman, so I don't know what he may have said or may not have said. I doubt very much if he quoted me relative to what this country might do or might not do in case a blockade was declared by the League of Nations, because I am quite certain that I have never made any statement relative to it and quite certain further than that that this Government has never indicated what it would do or would not do relative to any blockade that might be declared by the League.
