1929 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 280

Perhaps one of the most important accomplishments of my administration has been minding my own business.

Nothing special took place at the Cabinet this morning. I took occasion to thank the members for the service they had rendered to the country and to me, expressed my regret at severing my relations with them, which have been so pleasant and agreeable, and I think a paraphrase of that kind would be about all I could say to the members of the conference. You have been, I think, quite successful in interpreting the administration to the country. I have known that I wasn't much of a success in undertaking newspaper work, so I have left the work of reporting the affairs of my administration to the experts of the press. Perhaps that is the reason that the reports have been more successful than they would have been if I had undertaken myself to direct them. It has been a pleasure to have you come in twice a week and give me an opportunity to answer such queries as you wished to propound. I want to thank you again for your constant kindness and consideration. I hope you will find the years to come as pleasant to you as I have the years that are gone by pleasant to me.
