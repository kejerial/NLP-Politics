1927 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 180

To recur for a moment to the matter of limitation of arms. I don't know whether it would be feasible to secure any agreement with Japan and Great Britain. It might be that some progress could be made by a three-power agreement. But I should think that would be doubtful. The position of Great Britain, as I recall it, at the Washington conference was that unless some arrangement could be made with France for limitation on submarines and so on, that of course they couldn't make any limitation on those vessels that are used as a defense against submarine attacks.
