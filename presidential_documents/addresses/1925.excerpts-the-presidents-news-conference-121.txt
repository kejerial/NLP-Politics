1925 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 121

It would be possible to pass some laws that would be of benefit to transportation, but the main thing that it seems to me is needed in transportation is consolidations. There is one of those pending before the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Van Sweringens, and I imagine that some of the other transportation units are waiting to see how that comes out in order that they may get necessary information with which to proceed with consolidations. If we could get consolidations through, it would solve the problem, to quite an extent, of rates. We would then have sufficiently large units so that it would be possible to make a rate that would substantially take care of each unit and not give one railroad a very large income while another railroad under the same rate wouldn't get enough income to pay for its ex-istence.
