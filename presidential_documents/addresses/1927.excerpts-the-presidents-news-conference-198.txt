1927 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 198

I do not know of any needs in the War and Navy Departments that are likely to jeopardize the reduction of taxes. I am expecting some additional expenditure in those Departments, though I think that the Departments informed me that the additional expenditures would be rather for non-military purposes. The War and Navy Departments take a peculiar view of that. They always seem to think that if they can tell me that the expense is for non-military purposes it doesn't cost the taxpayer anything, and that, therefore, I ought to approve it. I am telling you that for your informationâ€”not for your publication.
