1948 Presentation Scroll Brigadier General Benjamin O Davis Upon His Retirement From The Us

It is a genuine pleasure to sign this special testimonial of the admiration and esteem of your host of Army comrades.
You are one of the select few who have devoted a half century in the active military service to the defense of the United States of America and the ideals of freedom and justice for which this country stands.
You have exemplified by your distinguished accomplishments in places of great trust and responsibility, too numerous to recount here, all that is best in a soldier of the highest type.
