1919 Remarks The Balcony The Philharmonic Club Turin Italy

It is very delightful to feel your friendship given so cordially and so graciously, and I hope with all my heart that in the peace that is now about to be concluded Italy may find her happiness and her prosperity. I am sure that I am only speaking the sentiments that come from the heart of the American people when I say, Viva l'Italia.
