1905 Remarks Hammond Louisiana

My fellow citizens and residents of Louisiana:
I am glad of this opportunity of telling you how proud I am to be within the borders of the great State of Louisiana, so rich in glorious traditions. It has been my intention to pay you a visit for a long time, but it would seem that circumstances have only lately been so as to make my visit possible. I wanted to come long ago, and indeed I would have come if I could have been of any use, but you have done all that was necessary.
Let me express to you my pleasure at knowing that you have worked conscientiously through the long summer months, for which such splendid results show today. Louisiana was never found wanting when the time came to act. You have followed traditions of earlier years, such as were set down by the men, some of whom I see before me now, who wore the blue. I am glad to be able to look into your faces and to feel that you have done your duty.
