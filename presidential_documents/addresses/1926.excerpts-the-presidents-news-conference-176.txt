1926 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 176

I don't know as there is much of anything that I can say about Nicaragua. It has been apparent to me that the press has been considerably misled in respect to American activities in that country. There is a revolution going on there and whenever a condition of that kind exists in Central American countries it means trouble for our citizens that are there and it is almost always necessary for this country to take action for their protection, protecting their safety and protecting their property. That is what is being done at the present time. This Government is not taking any sides, one way or the other, in relation to the revolution. It never takes sides in those matters. Admiral [Julian L.] Latimer is there with a landing force of Marines and they have not molested Sacasa, the head of the revolutionary movement, or any members of his Cabinet. Sacasa and his Cabinet are still at Puerto Cabezas where they are treated the same as other Nicaraguans. I understand that the American Lumber Company has furnished Sacasa with a house without any cost to him and tells him he can continue to occupy the house as long as he desires. The landing force has not molested him in any way. Of course, as I have stated, the marines are there simply for the protection of American and foreign lives and property wherever it may be necessary. I think that is the extent of the action that this government has taken.
