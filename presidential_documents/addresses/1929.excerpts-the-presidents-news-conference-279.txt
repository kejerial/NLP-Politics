1929 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 279

I have a telegram from Mayor [Malcolm E.] Nichols of Boston urging construction of one of the new cruisers at the Navy Yard at Boston. I think every time there is any naval construction work to be done that each of the navy yards in the United States sends word to the Department and the President, and oftentimes their delegation waits on the Department, and urges that the work be done in their yard. All that I can say to any of those is that we will try and have the work done where it seems to be most advantageous to the country and the Navy, and also do anything we can to assist any locality. Navy yards, you know, really ought to be for the benefit of the Navy and the country. Yet, they are generally considered to be for the benefit of the locality in which they are located.
