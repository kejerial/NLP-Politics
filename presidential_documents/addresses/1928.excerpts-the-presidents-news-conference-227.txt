1928 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 227

There is always danger that the Congress will be too liberal in the matter of appropriations. It doubled the appropriation that I proposed for the Shipping Board and I think added $6,000,000 or $8,000,000 to the Army bill, and it is true that if it goes on at that rate there won't be any surplus with which to meet tax reduction. Of course, according to my best judgment, there should be added to the sums I have already mentioned $65,000,000 that has been put into the tax bill, which is in excess of what I believe tax reduction ought to include.
