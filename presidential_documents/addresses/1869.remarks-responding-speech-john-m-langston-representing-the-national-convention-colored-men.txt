1869 Remarks Responding Speech John M Langston Representing The National Convention Colored Men

I thank the convention of which you are the representatives for the confidence they have expressed, and I hope sincerely that the colored people of the nation may receive every protection which the laws give them. They shall have my efforts to secure such protection. They should prove by their acts, their advancement, prosperity, and obedience to the laws worthy of all privileges the Government has bestowed upon them by their future conduct, and prove themselves deserving of all they now claim.
