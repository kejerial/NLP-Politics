1928 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 255

I have no additional information as to the Anglo-French agreement about limitation of naval armaments. I understand it is more in the nature of a proposal than an agreement. I am not contemplating at present taking any further steps about the limitation of armaments. There is a preliminary conference going on that has been going on for some years, which we have been attending. There isn't anything outside of that that I know of which is contemplated at the present time with a view to securing further limitations.
