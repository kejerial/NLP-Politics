1928 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 267

Of course, a good many proposals are made by people that have very excellent things that they would like to have the Government do, but they come from people that have no responsibility for providing ways and means by which their proposals can be carried out. I don't think in all my experience, which has been very large with people that come before me in and out of the Government with proposals for spending money, I have ever had any proposal from anyone as to what could be done to raise money, and very few suggestions of what could be done to save any money. Sometimes linked with the proposal for an im-mediate large expenditure is the suggestion that it ultimately will result in a saving. I think that is about the extent of the outside assistance I have had in that direction.
