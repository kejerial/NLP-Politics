1927 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 214

I have referred to the State Department a suggestion that came to me that something might be secured relative to the World Court by further negotiations. I haven't in mind exactly the language of the replies that were secured by the Department when it notified the different countries that were signers of the treaty that our country was willing to adhere to it in accordance with the resolution passed by the Senate. Whether there is anything in those that would give any en-couragement to further negotiation, I therefore could not tell. So far as I know, they were not of a nature that encouraged the thought that further negotiation might bring about positive results, and so far as I have made inquiry of men in the Senate who were very friendly to the World Court proposal they have uniformly indicated to me that they would not be willing to support any modification of the position that the Senate had already taken. I thought the general result of the conference that was held by the other members of the Court was quite a strong indication that they would not wish to have our country be-come a member of the Court if it was going to involve any modification of the present rules governing the action of the different countries that have established it, in relation to it.
