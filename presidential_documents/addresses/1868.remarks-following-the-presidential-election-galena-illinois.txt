1868 Remarks Following The Presidential Election Galena Illinois

I thank you for this additional mark of your kindness. Sufficient has now been heard of the result of the late election to show upon whom it has fallen to administer the affairs of the nation for the next four years. I suppose it is no egotism in me to say that the choice has fallen upon me. The responsibilities of the position I feel, but accept them without fear, if I can have the same support which has been given to me thus far. I thank you and all others who have fought together in this contestâ€”a contest in which you are all interested personally as much, and perhaps more than I am. I now take occasion to bid you good bye, as I leave here tomorrow for Washington, and shall probably see but few of you again for some years to come; although it would give me great pleasure to make an annual pilgrimage to a place where I have enjoyed myself so much as I have here during the past few months.
