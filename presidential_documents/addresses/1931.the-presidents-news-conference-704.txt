1931 The Presidents News Conference 704

THE PRESIDENT. I haven't anything for you this morning at all, I am sorry to say. I have just said that part of you, at least, will have a chance to get seasick for the next 3 days to see whether you can find any news out of that. Otherwise than the fact that we are going, I haven't got anything to give you.
