1931 Remarks Presenting Special Congressional Medal Lincoln Ellsworth

ON BEHALF OF the Congress of the United States it gives me great pleasure to hand you this gold medal for your conspicuous courage, sagacity, and perseverance on your polar flight of 1925, and transpolar flight of 1926. Please accept my congratulations, and the congratulations of the American people.
In reading of your explorations, I learn of the noble assistance rendered you at all times by your sister, Mrs. Bernon S. Prentice. I regret that she has not lived to see you receive this medal. Her life was a fine example of the fortitude of our American women.
