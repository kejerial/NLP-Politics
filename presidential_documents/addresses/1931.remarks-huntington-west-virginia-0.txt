1931 Remarks Huntington West Virginia 0

Governor Conley and fellow citizens:
It is most kind of you to give to Mrs. Hoover and me this courteous and beautiful welcome. It is a greeting so warm and so generous that it is difficult to find terms in which to respond. We do deeply appreciate it. I have greatly enjoyed this journey through West Virginia. The Nation shares with the State its pride in its beautiful scenery, its homes, and its industries.
I have the opportunity for renewed contact with your Governor and with your most able and devoted Senator. Huntington may well be proud of their citizens who take so large a part in National Government. It has been a pleasure to again meet with your Mr. Hallanan and Mrs. Yost, who represent you upon the Republican National Committee.
All one can say in response to greetings of so warm and cordial a character is wholly inadequate. I wish I could adequately thank you on behalf of both Mrs. Hoover and myself.
