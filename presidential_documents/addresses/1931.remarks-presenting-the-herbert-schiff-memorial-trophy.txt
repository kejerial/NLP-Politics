1931 Remarks Presenting The Herbert Schiff Memorial Trophy

Lieutenant Commander Whitehead:
As the United States Naval Reserve Aviation Base at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, New York, has been awarded the Herbert Schiff Memorial Trophy for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1931, I take pleasure in turning over to you, as the Commanding Officer of that Base, this splendid memorial trophy. The record of your base, with 3,441 hours of flying time, without accident to personnel or material, is an accomplishment well worthy of commendation. Please accept for the officers and men under your command my heartiest congratulations.
