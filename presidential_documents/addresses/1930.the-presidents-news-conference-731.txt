1930 The Presidents News Conference 731

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS
THE PRESIDENT. I had one question about District appropriations. I understand negotiations have been resumed on that subject.
GENERAL EDGAR JADWIN
I have a question on the Power Commission. I have selected General Jadwin for the chairmanship of the Power Commission, and he has accepted. The other members have not yet been settled on, but will be sent to the Senate in the special session.
And that is all that I have at the present time.
