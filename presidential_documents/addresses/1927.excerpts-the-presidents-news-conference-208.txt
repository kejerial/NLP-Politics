1927 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 208

I am expecting to be present to confer the Hubbard Medal of the National Geographic Society upon Colonel [Charles] Lindbergh, I think that is on Monday evening, and I am having a lunch Monday at 1:00 o'clock for those who have made transoceanic flights either in whole or in part. That is the only entertainment that I have in mind to provide for them.
