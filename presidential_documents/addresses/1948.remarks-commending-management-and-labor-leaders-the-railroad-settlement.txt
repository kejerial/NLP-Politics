1948 Remarks Commending Management And Labor Leaders The Railroad Settlement

I WANT to congratulate you gentlemen on this settlement. It is great for our country. I wanted to see this thing settled as it should be done, by bargaining and not in any other way. You did this on your own hook, and I feel very good about it. I congratulate all of you on it. I am satisfied that you would like to have this publicly known as a settlement on your own hook, and I am going to ask you gentlemen to go out of here and tell the press exactly what happened and what the agreement is.
Again I want to congratulate you.
