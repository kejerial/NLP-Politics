1921 Remarks Lincoln University Chester County Pennsylvania

Dr. Rendall, members of the graduating class, and fellow-countrymen:
It is a very great pleasure to stop here for a few moments to offer a word of greeting to such an institution on such an occasion. The colored citizens of America in the World War earned the right to be memorialized. I am glad to pay tribute to an educational institution like this one.
Much is said about the problem of the races, but let me tell you that there is nothing that government can do which is akin to educational work. One of the great difficulties with popular government is that citizenship expects at the hands of government that which it should do for itself. No Government can wave a magical wand and take a race from bondage to citizenship in half a century. All that the Government can do is to afford an opportunity for good citizenship.
The colored race, in order to come into its own, must do the great work itself, in preparing for that participation. Nothing will accomplish so much as educational preparation. I commend the valuable work which this institution is doing in that direction. It is a fine contrast to the unhappy and distressing spectacle that we saw the other day out in one of the Western States. God grant that, in the soberness, the fairness and the justice of this country, we shall never have another spectacle like it.
