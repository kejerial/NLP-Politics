1926 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 174

PRESS: IS General Wood coming home?
PRESIDENT: It has been expected that he would come home for a visit some time this season. He hasn't been back for five years. I thought perhaps he would be back last winter, but he didn't seem to be able to get away. The Vice-Governor, I think he is called Vice-Governor, was over here last winter. Now we have been expecting that General Wood would come back this winter. He has recently been ill. I understand he is making a good recovery. Whether that would interfere with his coming over, I don't know. I hardly think so. He ought not to stay in the Philippines as long as that. The climate is difficult. The duties are difficult. A person accustomed to our temperate climate ought to have an opportunity to get out of a climate as warm and trying as that of the Philippines for a considerable length of time, much oftener than five years. I speak of that as an indication of the devotion that General Wood has shown towards his duties and his intense loyalty in their discharge.
