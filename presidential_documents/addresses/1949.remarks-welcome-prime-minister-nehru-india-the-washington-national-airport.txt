1949 Remarks Welcome Prime Minister Nehru India The Washington National Airport

Mr. Prime Minister:
I am very happy to welcome you to this country on behalf of the Government and the people of the United States. I greet you not only as the chief minister of your government, but also as the loved and respected leader of a great nation of free people.
Destiny willed it that our country should have been discovered in the search for a new route to yours. I hope your visit, too, will be in a sense a discovery of the United States of America.
I extend to you the hospitality and good will of the people of the United States, with the hope that your visit among us will leave you with the firm conviction that we are indeed your warm friends.
