1928 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 238

The farm bill meets 3 or 4 of the objections that I raised to the bill of last year in my veto message. There are a great many other objections that I raised that the present bill doesn't meet. I am advised that the claim is being made that all the objections that I raised have been met, with the exception of the constitutional objection to the equalization fee. That doesn't appear to me to be the case. I hope that none of the members of the Congress will be misled by any rumors of that kind. I hope they may pass some reasonable farm legislation, but I am afraid that the present bill will not meet what I held to be the requirements.
