1927 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 184

I didn't speak of Mr. Hoover's abilities the other day. I had rather assumed that that would be assumed by the conference. His reputation is so well established in this country, and indeed abroad, for ability and executive achievement that I doubt very much if I should be able to shake it even if I wished to. Certainly, I have no desire to do that and shouldn't want to be thought so lacking in appreciation of a man of his abilities as to think that he wasn't well qualified for any position in the Cabinet that he would be willing to accept. Of course, the place that he is in now is one of great importance and of constantly increasing importance, not only on account of our domestic commerce, but on account of our foreign commerce, which under his direction and encouragement has very greatly increased and shows promise of further increase in the future.
