1930 The Presidents News Conference 777

THE PRESIDENT. The dearth of news still continues about this place. I am not engaged right now in making news.
I have just one question and that is regarding our attitude toward a loan to Santo Domingo. We will not in any way obstruct Santo Domingo in the making of a loan for the purposes set forth, and we are delighted to cooperate.
That is as far as there is any excitement that I know of. I thank you.
