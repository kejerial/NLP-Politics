1931 Remarks Columbus Ohio

THIS STOP has been one of unusual welcome and enthusiasm. There is not time for me to shake hands with each of you, for it is about time for your dinner.
Mrs. Hoover and I want to express our appreciation for this welcome-for this is an unusual welcome--so I will shake hands collectively with all of you.
