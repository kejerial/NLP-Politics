1927 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 205

It won't be possible for me to attend the World Series Rodeo, I think that is what they call it—at New York. Clyde Jones and I had a little rodeo of our own out on the south lot, which will duly appear on the screen and in the stills. I think that is about as far as I can go. I am no rodeo entertainer.
I shall not be able to go to the Army and Navy football game in New York. I wish I might go. I am interested in that game. It takes too much time to attend it. The last Army and Navy football game I attended—I guess it is the last one but one—it rained all the time. They had us seated out in the choice seats out in front, which were very choice in fair weather, but lacking anything but choiceness when it rained.
