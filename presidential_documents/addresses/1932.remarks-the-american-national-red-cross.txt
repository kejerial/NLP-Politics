1932 Remarks The American National Red Cross

During the past year the Red Cross has carried a great load in the national burden. It is serving at the same time to give relief from drought, from flood, from storm, from unemployment. It daily demonstrates that fine sense of service and devotion which expresses the heart of the American people. You have discharged your trust. In the name of the American people I wish to convey to every individual member, to every chapter, to your central staff, and to your devoted Chairman, the appreciation and the gratitude of the whole Nation. May the Great Providence add to your strength, your courage, and your steadfastness during the next year.
