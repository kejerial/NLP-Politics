1924 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 75

There is a general difference, practically speaking, that way between all the departments and the Bureau of the Budget, but that is in the way of a preliminary examination of each department's estimate, and they have an opportunity to come to me when the budget is finally made, it is my budget. I have to take the responsibility for it when I submit it to the Congress, and I am here if the departments want to talk to me about any parts of the budget.
