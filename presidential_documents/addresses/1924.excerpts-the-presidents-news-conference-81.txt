1924 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 81

I hardly expect to go to Northampton to vote, though I haven't made up my mind fully about that. I should go there by all means, if I could go without the necessary train attendants that always have to go when the President goes anywhere. I have to take so many people with me that if it takes any kind of a journey, why for myself and Mrs. Coolidge it is a good deal of an undertaking, and of course there is a considerable expense to the Government. I may go, but I haven't decided yet.
