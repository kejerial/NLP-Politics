1932 Rear Platform Remarks New Mexico And Kansas

[1.] TUCUMCARI, NEW MEXICO
We are no longer in a political campaign. So I accept this as an evidence of your friendship, and I deeply appreciate it. That is as much of a political speech as I can make for you.
[2.] LIBERAL, KANSAS
My voice does not carry very far. I do want to express my appreciation for so fine a greeting as this. I appreciate it deeply. Now that the campaign is over, it is a mark of friendship, and I thank you for it.
