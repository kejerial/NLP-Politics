1929 The Presidents News Conference 848

THE PRESIDENT. I have nothing today of any kind. I have some questions here on the reparations settlement on which I am unable to comment, as there is everything in the press that we have.
I also have some questions as to holidays during the summer. I am condemned to work this summer and stay in Washington so that I expect nothing out of it but Saturday afternoons and Sunday. Other than that I have nothing to help you with today.
