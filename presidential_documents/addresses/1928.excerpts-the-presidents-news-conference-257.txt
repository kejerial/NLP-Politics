1928 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 257

Ambassador Houghton hasn't resigned. I don't know whether he intends to resign, and of course any speculation about a hypothetical situation of that kind while it might not be premature on the part of the press, which always delights in speculation, would be quite premature on my part. I have all I can do in dealing with facts and realities and leaving the press to deal with hypothetical situations. They are much better equipped to do that than I am.

There have been and probably will continue to be efforts to make some arrangement by which the taxpayers of America may pay the German reparations. That isn't looked on with any favor in this country, nor do we see that it has any connection with the debts that are due to our country. Those have all been settled, with some trifling exceptions, and all been ratified but one. I don't see any good result to be secured by discussing it in the press. It has been my policy for a long time to refrain from any discussion in relation to it, consider-ing it as a closed incident.
