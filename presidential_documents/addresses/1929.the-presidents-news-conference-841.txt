1929 The Presidents News Conference 841

THE PRESIDENT. Well, I have no demands from your side--either verbal request or written or otherwise. I have just said I have no production ready for delivery on my side, so I am afraid we haven't anything to go on with.
I am sorry, but I think you have got enough to do to keep you busy today.
