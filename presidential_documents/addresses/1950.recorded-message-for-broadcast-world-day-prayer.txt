1950 Recorded Message For Broadcast World Day Prayer

On this day of prayer and religious dedication and for the coming New Year, I want also to extend to our friends in other lands the best wishes of the people of the United States and my own personal wishes on this holiday which has come to mean more than a day of rejoicing with friends and family. Our thoughts and prayers go with all men regardless of race, creed, or nationality who share with us our hopes for peace and freedom in the times to come. I am confident that with understanding and determination we shall move steadily toward these goals. I send all of you again my greetings and best wishes.
