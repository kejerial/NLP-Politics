1905 Remarks Newcastle Colorado

I have always believed in your people. I think that this is going to be one of the greatest states of the Union, not merely in its material development, but in its type of citizenship.
Now, I want to pass to the generation that is coming on, and congratulate Colorado upon what she is doing with her public schools, upon her whole force of teachers, and upon the steps that are being taken to train aright the next generation. I believe in the mines; I believe, as you know, in the irrigation works; I believe in your stock ranches, in everything; but the real crop is the crop of children, for if you get that all straight, the other crops will take care of themselves in the end. I want to say what a pleasure it has been to see the way in which the next generation is being started out on its life task here in Colorado. I thank you very, very much for coming here, and I am glad to see you.
