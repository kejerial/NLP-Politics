1932 Remarks The State House Plaza Des Moines Iowa

I suppose you have been listening a long time to what I have to say, and there is not much I can add that would help at this hour of night. On the other hand, I am glad to have opportunity to tell you how much I appreciate the welcome you have extended to Mrs. Hoover and me on return to our native State. We have seen today nothing but the outpourings of affection and welcome. I cannot recall any time in my life when I was so stimulated and encouraged as by the support I have found here in my home State.
I thank you.
