1925 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 131

I don't recall having received any protest from Mr. [J. W.] Frame, of Alaska against the conduct of two Federal judges there. It may be that some protest of that kind has been sent to this office. If it was sent here it would be referred in due course of business to the Department of Justice for investigation and report to me. That leads me to remark about Alaska, that I think protests that originate up there against those who are holding office perhaps would need considerable investigation in order to determine just how much merit they have. It is my information that one person in every 11 of the white people that live in Alaska are on the Federal payroll. Business is not brisk up there. There are some fisheries there and some mining, but we are spending $11,000,000 a year so that I think the best line of endeavor that there is in Alaska is to get on to the Federal payroll. Now I presume it is unconscious, but a condition of that kind would stimulate an activity on the part of those that aren't on the payroll to criticism of those that are, in order that a change might be made to their advantage, so that whenever there are protests against Federal officers up there they have to be viewed with that in mind.
