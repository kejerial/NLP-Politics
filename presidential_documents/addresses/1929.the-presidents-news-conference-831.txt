1929 The Presidents News Conference 831

APPOINTMENTS
THE PRESIDENT. The only questions I have relate to some appointments in the District, and each one starts "Is the White House considering a successor to former Chief Justice, et cetera." I am certainly considering successors. That is part of my job, but I haven't got conclusions.
We will have some appointments of interest during the afternoon, I hope. Otherwise than that I haven't got any news at all.
Q. Will they be local appointments or national ?
THE PRESIDENT. National.
So that I am afraid I can't help you out this morning. It is getting time for Christmas and you don't want to work anyway.
