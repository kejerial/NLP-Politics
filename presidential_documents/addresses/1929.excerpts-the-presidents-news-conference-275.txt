1929 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 275

Mr. Sanders has compiled a report showing that during 1928 I made about 20 addresses and Messages to the Congress. I think that is 2 more than 1927, isn't it, Mr. Sanders?
MR. SANDERS: About the same.
PRESIDENT: It is too many, but it indicates something of the pressure that the President is under constantly to make efforts of that kind.
PRESS: DO you mind giving us an indication of how many invitations you have refused?
PRESIDENT: I wouldn't have any idea about that. A very great many.
