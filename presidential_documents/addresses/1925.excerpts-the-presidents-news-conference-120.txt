1925 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 120

I haven't seen Senator Borah's article on the proposal that the United States keep out of affairs of American Republics. I have before me this editorial in relation to it. I suppose that if that is what he has proposed, that that was one of the fundamental desires of this country, to keep out of the affairs of American republics just so far as we can. We never interfere with them except in the case of last resort, and whatever action we are taking now in American republics is because of the request of the duly authorized government there that we do so. Even that we don't like to do. So if that is his suggestion, that we keep out of the affairs of American republics, the suggestion is wise and timely and is in accordance with what I understand to be the policy of this country.
