1949 Remarks The Swearing Associate Justice Tom Clark

FOR THE last time Mr. Attorney General, I hand you a Commission as Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.
We have had a great Attorney General for the last 4 years, and we will have a great Justice of the Court from now on.
I present you to your wonderful chief.
