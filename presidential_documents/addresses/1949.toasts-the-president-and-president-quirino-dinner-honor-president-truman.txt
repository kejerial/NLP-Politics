1949 Toasts The President And President Quirino Dinner Honor President Truman

Mr. President, I am extremely happy that you are not going home emptyhearted, and I am very sure you won't go home empty-handed, either.
I appreciate most highly this presentation, and I shall treasure it all my life, and give it to my daughter.
I want to drink to the health of the first President of the Philippine Republic who has visited the United States of America.
May he live long and happily, and be prosperous as the President of the Philippines.
