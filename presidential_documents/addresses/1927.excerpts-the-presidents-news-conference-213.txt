1927 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 213

I do not think the question of whether a man might be called a military man or not is one of very great importance in relation to the Governor Generalship of the Philippine Islands. I suppose what is meant by that is the attitude of mind of the man. Some civilians may have what I would designate as a very military type of mind. Some men who may be officers in the Army and the Navy might not have a military type of mind at all. I think thisâ€”that the Governor Generalship of the Philippine Islands would probably be better administered, as any civil office would be, by a man who didn't have a predominantly military type of mind. That wouldn't by any means eliminate plenty of men we have in the Army and Navy, and I would not think that Governor General Wood was a man that had a predominant military type of mind.
