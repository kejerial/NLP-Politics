1929 Remarks During Motor Tour Detroit Michigan

Governor Green, citizens of Detroit:
I do appreciate the generosity and courtesy of your welcome. There is no lack of warmth in the faces and hearts of the people of Detroit despite the action of the skies.
I have thought it a fitting thing, as the Governor has said, for the President of the United States to take part in paying honor to one of our great Americans, Thomas A. Edison.
Mr. Edison has brought to our country great distinction throughout the world. He has brought great benefactions to all of us, and it is but a small thing we may do to record the appreciation, esteem, and honor in which the Nation holds him.
Detroit is fortunate it is to be the point where the Nation pays its tribute to Thomas A. Edison, and I wish to thank you again for your cordiality and the courtesy of your welcome.
Thank you.
