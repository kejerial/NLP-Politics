1926 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 170

I haven't seen the book of Lindsay Rogers [The American Senate, N. Y., 1926], It may possibly have been sent to me. I judge from this question that it is a discussion of the constitutional limits of the activities of the United States Senate. I think there was a British reviewer of books—supposed to be a great authority—who said he never read a book before he reviewed it because it might prejudice him.

Nothing has developed in the Russian situation. I do not like to keep discussing that situation. It is not understood by the people generally perhaps that I respond to questions submitted, and it would seem to indicate that the President is constantly saying something about Russia. I have no disposition to say anything about it, and until something develops I think in the future you may expect that I will not make any comment about it. Of course, I am very glad to give at any time any information that may come, but I do not want to keep making comments unless there is information developed about which comment can helpfully be made.
