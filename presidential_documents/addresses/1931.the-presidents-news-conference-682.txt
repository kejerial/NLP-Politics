1931 The Presidents News Conference 682

BENEDICT CROWELL
THE PRESIDENT. I have today forwarded to the Senate the nomination of Mr. Benedict Crowell, of Cleveland, as a brigadier general of the Reserve Corps of the Army. As you know, Mr. Crowell has long been a member of the Reserve Corps, and he did very distinguished service during the war as Assistant Secretary of War and subsequently as the Director of Munitions. And this promotion in itself is not so material as it affords an opportunity to indicate the feeling of his Army associates and his friends in the War Department and my own feeling toward what we have always considered was an inadvertent but very grave injustice.
FEDERAL POWER COMMISSIONERS
I have some inquiries here for the Attorney General's opinion on the three Power Commissioners. The Attorney General will release that opinion for you this afternoon if you want it.
Otherwise, I have nothing on this occasion.
