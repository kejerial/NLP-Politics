1927 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 190

I haven't seen the suggestion that is referred to as having been made by Ambassador Herrick that Lindbergh be sent to fly to various European capitals. There would be some difficulty about arranging that through Government action. I had seen some reports in the press that he was contemplating flights to different portions of Europe. The more we learn of his accomplishment in going from New York to Paris, the greater it seems to have been. That is something that grows on us the more we contemplate it.

I was naturally very much pleased with the report of Colonel Stimson, former Secretary of War, on his return from Nicaragua. He told me that he would prepare a short statement and give it to the press, which I think he did and which covered the vital points that he reported to me. He is very certain that peace has been entirely re-established and all bands of any consequence that were engaged in warfare in Nicaragua have delivered their arms to the United States authorities there, both those that represented the government and those that represented the revolutionary forces. It was a very excellent accomplishment on the part of Colonel Stimson and one to which he is entitled to great credit. I am personally very appreciative of what he did there and it was a great service to the people of Nicaragua and a service that the people of this country may view with a good deal of satisfaction, I am sure.
