1931 The Presidents News Conference 691

RUMORS OF CABINET RESIGNATIONS
THE PRESIDENT. I haven't anything of any great importance today. Justfor background and to quiet some of the recent rumors for you, I can tell you that Messrs. [Ray Lyman] Wilbur, [William D.] Mitchell, and [Arthur M.] Hyde are not going to resign from the Cabinet. That is not for quotation but just so that you will know. And in case that hardy perennial about Mr. [Andrew W.] Mellon turns up, you can be satisfied that that won't happen either.
Q. That comes on Thursday.
THE PRESIDENT. Yes. The Wilbur one seems to be happening every Friday now.
But otherwise I haven't anything at all today. If you can think up some device by which we can stir public interest you might let me know.
