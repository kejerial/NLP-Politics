1930 The Presidents News Conference 697

REPORT OF THE HAITIAN COMMISSION
THE PRESIDENT. The only thing I have today is the Haitian Commission's report. You will find their recommendations on page 19, and the administration will adopt those recommendations as the basis of its policies in Haiti. I leave it to you to read the recommendations and save you time and trouble. You will find them all in the book, and we will present you with the book at once.
And that is all I have got for this occasion.
Q. Mr. President, may we take it that you approve this report ?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes--we will follow the recommendations as the basis of our Haiti policies.
