1929 The Presidents News Conference 810

THE PRESIDENT. Well, I have one question today, and I am not quite in a position to make an adequate reply to it, so this is a famine day, I am sorry to say. I have nothing on my mind, and apparently you have nothing on yours very much. I am sorry I haven't anything
Q. Mr. President, are you going away tomorrow ?
THE PRESIDENT. I am thinking of going away about 10 or 11 o'clock.
