1927 Excerpts The Presidents News Conference 199

I have appointedâ€”I haven't put the appointment on paper, but have made arrangements to appoint and have secured the approbation of the government of Mexico to the appointment of Dwight W. Morrow, of New Jersey, to be Ambassador to Mexico. [Stenographer's note: One or more of the correspondents left the room hurriedly at this point.] I hope that is not going to cause any considerable exodus from the room. I can well understand how anyone would like to go out to congratulate the country. I am very much pleased that Mr. Morrow is going to make the sacrifice that is entailed by accepting an appointment of this kind. He of course is retiring from his firm, of which he has been a member for thirteen years. He is a lawyer by profession, is very much interested in public affairs and has made a study of them. He is wonderfully well equipped I think to take a mission of that kind. It is one of our most important foreign missions although perhaps not one that would be so much sought after as an appointment at St. James or at Paris.
PRESS: IS he going at once?
PRESIDENT: I do not know just how soon he will go. I suppose in a very few days.
