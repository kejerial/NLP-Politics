1949 Toasts The President And President Dutra Dinner The Brazilian Embassy

Mr. President:
In Rio de Janeiro you set a precedent for courtesy and hospitality. As best we can we have been attempting to return to you and to the people of Brazil those wonderful tributes and pleasant times which we had when Mrs. Truman and my daughter Margaret and I visited your great capital.
I sincerely hope that you have had an enjoyable visit in Washington, and I sincerely hope that you will have a pleasant visit in New York City. I hope that you will enjoy the tour over the Tennessee Valley Authority, and your visit to Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn.
You have fulfilled my idea of what a President ought to be. You rise an hour earlier than I do, you walk better than I do, and you call your cabinet into session before breakfast, which I think I shall institute in Washington.
Mr. President, to your health, and to the continued friendship of Brazil and the United States!
