1947 Toasts The President And The President Elect Uruguay

We are very fortunate today to have as our guest the President-elect of Uruguay, our good friend. We appreciate very much his being here today. We want him to enjoy his visit in the United States. We want to contribute to that enjoyment all we can. I have always been curious to see his country. I hope some time that I shall have a chance to do it.
The President brought me a booklet today, with pictures of his farm, and his son and his grandson; and he has grapes just like these. He says they are even better than California grapes ever pretend to be. I should like to go some time and sample them.
But I am sure that he does just what he says he does. We are indeed glad to have him in the United States, and I should like to propose a toast to the President-elect of our neighboring Republic.
